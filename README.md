Python Notepad using tkinter Library

## Google Colab does not natively support Tkinter because Tkinter is a graphical user interface (GUI) library that requires a display to run. Google Colab is a cloud-based service that runs in a web browser, and web browsers do not have displays. So, it is recommended to use the given code on platforms such as VScode.
